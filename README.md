## Introduction
Provide a brief overview of the project, its purpose, and what problem it aims to solve.
The aim of this project is to receive a license plate number sent by the mobile application by Jetbot via an API and park it autonomously in the license plate area on the platform. While carrying out the project, software such as image processing, artificial intelligence and mobile development were used.
